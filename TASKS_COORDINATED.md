# COORDINATED IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

**Purpose**: Task list for the coordinated implementation phase where all dependency upgrades are applied simultaneously using yarn resolutions. This is the critical synchronization point where all individual dependency upgrades come together.

**Dependencies Involved**:
- minimist: 0.0.8/1.2.0 → 1.2.8
- shell-quote: 1.6.1/1.7.2 → 1.8.3
- hermes-engine: 0.2.1 → 0.11.0
- logkitty: 0.6.1 → 0.7.1

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Coordinated atomic operation

## TASK LIST

### Pre-Implementation Backup
- [ ] **COORD-1**: Create backup of current yarn.lock file

### Implementation (ATOMIC OPERATION)
- [ ] **COORD-2**: Add all yarn resolutions to package.json simultaneously:
  ```json
  "resolutions": {
    "minimist": "1.2.8",
    "shell-quote": "1.8.3",
    "hermes-engine": "0.11.0",
    "logkitty": "0.7.1"
  }
  ```

### Application and Verification
- [ ] **COORD-3**: Run 'yarn install' to apply all resolutions
- [ ] **COORD-4**: Verify all target versions appear in yarn.lock
- [ ] **COORD-5**: Run 'yarn audit' to confirm vulnerability resolution

## INTEGRATION TESTING TASKS
- [ ] **INTEG-1**: Test React Native library build process end-to-end
- [ ] **INTEG-2**: Verify no dependency conflicts in resolution tree
- [ ] **INTEG-3**: Test library functionality with all upgraded dependencies
- [ ] **INTEG-4**: Run performance benchmarks if available
- [ ] **INTEG-5**: Test compatibility with React Native 0.61.5 consumer apps
- [ ] **INTEG-6**: Verify no breaking changes to library API

## ROLLBACK PROCEDURES
- [ ] **ROLLBACK-1**: Restore original yarn.lock if critical issues found
- [ ] **ROLLBACK-2**: Remove yarn resolutions from package.json
- [ ] **ROLLBACK-3**: Run 'yarn install' to restore original versions
- [ ] **ROLLBACK-4**: Document rollback reason and alternative approach

## CRITICAL NOTES
- **PREREQUISITE**: All individual dependency compatibility tasks must be completed first
- **ESPECIALLY**: hermes-engine compatibility must be confirmed before proceeding
- **ATOMIC OPERATION**: All resolutions must be added together, not individually
- **ROLLBACK READY**: Keep original yarn.lock for immediate rollback if needed
- This phase gates the success of the entire upgrade process
